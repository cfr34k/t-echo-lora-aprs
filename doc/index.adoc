= LoRa-APRS Firmware for the LilyGo T-Echo

This is a custom firmware for the T-Echo devices made by Lilygo.

With this firmware the T-Echo becomes a LoRa-APRS tracker that can report your
current location (and more) to the APRS network. The LoRa technology makes it
possible to achieve large coverage even with these low power devices. Up to 5
km are usually possible in cities, 20 km in rural areas and more than 100 km
with a direct line of sight.
